import PackageDescription

// Sekiban Swift SDK — one SPM package exposing both SDK layers as separate
// targets/products. This exact manifest is mirrored to the repository root of
// github.com/J-Tech-Japan/sekiban-swift (SwiftPM resolves packages from a
// repository root only), so target, product, and import names below are public
// API fixed before the first publish:
//
//   * `SekibanWasm` — FFI plumbing for Sekiban WASM projector modules
//     (read/write UTF-8 strings in linear memory, pack/unpack pointer+length
//     into a single i64, alloc/dealloc exports) plus the primitive projection
//     C-ABI export stubs so an MV-only module still satisfies the host's
//     export probe.
//   * `SekibanMv` — Swift companion to the host-side MV wire contracts
//     (`WasmMvBoundaryContracts`): Codable DTOs, the `WasmMvProjector`
//     protocol, a registry, `MvParamBuilder`, and the `mv_metadata` /
//     `mv_initialize` / `mv_apply_event` C-ABI exports generated from the
//     registry contents. Mirrors the responsibilities of the Rust `sekiban-mv`
//     crate.
